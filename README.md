#### Description

Basic Login/Register app, is a simple responsive application developed using React, React Hooks.
It was a project where I wanted to try new things. Of course something has more than one solution. And better it can be ofcourse.
### Built With

The major frameworks used when built the project:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [React-Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)
- [Eslint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- [i18n](https://react.i18next.com/)
- [Scss](https://sass-lang.com/)
- Atomic Design principles (Not exactly. But it has been tried)
- SASS 7+1 folder pattern (Has been tried)

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow steps:

### Prerequisites

This project is currently not dependent on any back-end, database or prerequisites. You can continue with the steps below.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/BurakCaglayan/basic-login-register-page-without-ui-library.git
   ```

2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start Project

   ```JS
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

You can switch login & register. You can enter your information in the input fields. It includes a few basic and simple actions. This application prints the information it receives from the user to the console in the form object.

### What could be better? What can be added?
- Scss can be used more effectively. Colors and many other things can be kept as variables.
- The buttons in the tab (nav) can be divided into small parts. The tab can be updated to include n buttons.
- There won't be many test cases, it can be easily developed.
- Validations for input fields can be added.

### What have I tried in this app?
- I developed the entire design without using any UI library. I wrote animations, albeit small ones.
- I started using scss. Enjoyable. But I need to practice a little more :)
- I tried to SASS 7+1 folder pattern.
- I tried to develop by following the Atomic Design principles. I developed reusable components.
- I developed a largely responsive design.
